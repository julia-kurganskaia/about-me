I'm a Software Developer with strong communication and soft skills background. Coding is my passion. I love designing intuitive and modern interfaces that give users a great experience.

In 2018 I was talking with a friend who works in tech and they told me that you don’t need to be a maths genius to code – “I’ll bet you would love it!”. I started my journey into software development through online programming courses and I found my love for the technical aspects, too. Now that I have come out of Enspiral Dev Academy bootcamp (Wellington, New Zealand) as a full stack software developer, it has really grasped my passion and interest in the industry. I am excited to see what’s around the corner in terms of my career.

You can find here some of the projects that were completed to deadlines over a period between 1-7 days during studying at Enspiral Dev Academy. My commits between January and March are a bit patchy as all the students were working in groups/pairs and as such some commits were made from different accounts.

The skills taught at EDA are very practical and cover all the tools of the trade. This course taught me not only to code, but how to think and work like a programmer.
